**Team Work Contract:**

Team Members: Amir Shojakhani, Luke Collins, Sukhleen Kaur

**Expectations:**

-   If team members are struggling to complete their sections, members should reach out on Slack at least 48 hours before the group submission date (Friday am) to see if work should be redistributed or to seek guidance.

All team members are expected to have a working or complete draft of their sections complete by Friday at noon so that there is ample time to make changes, seek help from TA's, and organize the milestone submission.

All submissions are expected to meet the criteria of the milestones as set out in the instructions. This includes making sure all scripts are working, creating tests for all your functions, and using proper grammar in written submissions.

**Meetings:**

-   Group members are expected to attend the lab virtually every Tuesday afternoon so that the group can meet and discuss the new milestone for the week, and distribute the work.

-   If a group member is unable to attend the lab/meeting they will notify the group on Slack.

-   A second shorter meeting will be held on Fridays at 10am to check in and organize the submission for the week.

-   Other meetings can be organized at the request of the group if needed, to address any problems.

**Communication:**

All communication outside of the meetings will be through Slack or Github. Github will be the primary communication tool for ideas, suggestions, submitting work and reviewing work. Slack will be the primary communication tool for informal communication and scheduling meetings.

**Reviews:**

All members are expected to submit a pull request for their work on the repository for the group project on Github.com. Members are expected to add teammates as reviewers to have all pull requests reviewed by another teammate. The team member who submitted the pull request will notify their reviewer, and the pull request should be reviewed within a reasonable amount of time, no later than 24 hours after creation. Small changes such as spelling, grammar updates and tiny fixes can be reviewed by the member who made them.

In the Tuesday meeting, reviewing "buddies" will be assigned to help the flow of review work, however any group member is permitted to review anything at any time if they would like and it is convenient.

**Roles:**

There are two roles team members will be responsible for each week. The roles are as follows:

-   Scribe and submission coordination (1):

    -   Responsible for taking notes at the meetings and adding the notes as a GitHub issue.

    -   Responsible for the collation and submission of the milestone for each week. As described above all group members are expected to have a draft finished by Friday at noon, so that the scribe can have ample time to set expectations for the submission.

-   Proof-readers (2)

    -   Responsible for doing a final check of the submission before the deadline to make sure all requirements are satisfied.

Positions will be rotated each week and distributed at the Tuesday meeting.

**Deadlines:**

Deadlines for individual items will be assigned during meetings.

**Breach of Contract:**

Failure to follow the team contract will result in a two-step warning system:

-   The first step is a written Slack notice that outlines the violation of the team contract and a reminder of the team contract conditions.

-   The second step is to reach out to the lab instructor or TAs of the issues with the teammate.
